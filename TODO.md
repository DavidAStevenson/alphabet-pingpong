# TODO
- Add a readiness check to the app, such that it indicates readiness once the NATS sever connection is acheived
- send something more interesting than mere single letters (e.g. current time + payload, for starters)
	- probably an id of the sending container, would be useful - see next item
- make the seeding really smart? have the app figure out which letter to try sending next to get the relay going?
	- for example, say a container comes up
		- it connects and listens...
		- if it hears nothing, then it chooses a letter and sends it
		- if it hears the same letter it sent
			- it's either the letter it sent echoing back
			- or another container has simultaneously sent the same letter
		- if it does not hear the same letter
			- it can assume after a few seconds that it owns the letter
		- for any remaining letters,
			- repeat the process
		- until there are no letters left unclaimed
			- and by this point the letters should be echoing around already
- add some kind of test suite (learn golang unit test framework(s))
- as it gets bigger, modularize the code appropriately
- make this observable somehow...
    - maybe just deploy ELK with it?
- get gnatsd running within the Kube cluster locally, and connect to it

- Car Park
    - setup vim-go extension, learn to use the fmt tool
		- in progress
		- https://github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial
    - learn vim multi-window tricks
		- https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~kuperman/help/vim/windows.html
	- try running vim with GOPATH on /c/ and see if performance is better
