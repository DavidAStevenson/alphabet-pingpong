- enable graceful shutdown and test it in Kubernetes
- Add a readiness check to the app, such that it indicates readiness once the NATS sever connection is acheived
- add some kind of test suite (learn golang unit test framework(s))
- as it gets bigger, modularize the code appropriately
- make this observable somehow...
    - maybe just deploy ELK with it?
- get gnatsd running within the Kube cluster locally, and connect to it
